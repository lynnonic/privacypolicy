This privacy policy governs your use of the software applications (&quot;Application&quot;) for mobile devices that was created by Light Indie Games.

**What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?**

The developer of the Application does not obtain information provided by a user. There is no registration required to use the Application. The developer will not obtain personally identifiable information from the users of the application.

The Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application.

We work with analytic systems, who need to know how you interact with advertising for the Application. Analytics obtain this information in an anonymous form. Analytics use the device&#39;s Advertising Identifier, which is a unique ID for each device and is the only way to provide more accurate data. This app uses the Advertising Identifier to

- Attribute this app installation to a previously served advertisement
- Attribute an action taken within this app to a previously served advertisement

This information is then transmitted to the third party partners.

Our third party partners and their privacy policies are as follows:

- [Firebase, AsMob, Google Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Fabric](https://fabric.io/terms) (Crashlytics)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/privacy/)
- [Unity analytics (optional)](https://unity3d.com/ru/legal/privacy-policy)

This app does not use Advertising Identifier, and any information obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier, in any way other than for limited analytics purposes (to provide a better user experience).
